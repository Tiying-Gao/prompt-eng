    "# Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting refers to a technique in prompt engineering where you provide a model with a task without any prior examples. The model is expected to understand and generate a response or complete the task purely based on the given instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the model is given \"zero\" prior training examples or demonstrations in the prompt and relies on its pre-trained knowledge to infer what is needed.\n",
